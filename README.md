Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period. I solved this problem using Data science and Machine learning technology, developed a web application which predicts the "Concrete compressive strength" based on the quantities of raw material, given as an input. Sounds like this saves a lot of time and effort right !
